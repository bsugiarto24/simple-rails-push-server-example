# Push notification backend example

This is a simple example of a backend that interacts with the Exponent
push API using [exponent-server-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/exponent/exponent-server-sdk-ruby).

When you create a new app in Exponent it hits this backend and it just
pushes a notification to your device. See the [Exponent starter
template](http://github.com/exponent/new-project-template)
for details on how to integrate with the backend on the client side.
